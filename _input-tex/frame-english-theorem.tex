\begin{theorem}
    There is no largest prime number.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
    Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers, then $q + 1$ is not
    divisible by any of them.
    But $q + 1$ is greater than $1$, thus divisible by some prime number
    not in the first $p$ numbers.\qedhere
\end{proof}
